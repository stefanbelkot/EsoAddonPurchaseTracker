[B]What it does?[/B]

It tracks all purchases done for a specific item and shows some statistics in the item popup.

--------------------

[B]Dependencies:[/B]
- AwesomeGuildStore>=2635 (I reuse an event from there to catch purchases, well, could have done it probably from an Eso event directly, but hell, you should install this addon anyway! :D )

--------------------

[B]How can it be used?[/B]

Well, keep track of for how much you bought items.
There are no configurations, no settings, it just works after activation

[B]Why did you (the uploader) create this addon?[/B]

Because I did not find anything similar doing just that, showing the price I purchased items in the item popup. 
Good to know if I want to resell something I found in some shop so I can define how much at least I must take to make some profit 
(TTC often shows too low prices, MasterMerchant too high to resell it fast enough ;) )

[B]Anything else the developer wants to say?[/B]

Yes, some special thanks to the developers of the addons I copied some code snippets from and learned how some things work:
- Master Merchant
- Tamriel Trade Center
- Awesome Guildstore
- @Baertram who gave me some tips in the comment section!
- and thanks to all others too! Existing code base is the best to learn from ;)

[B]Known Issues:[/B]

Update 1.0.0
just changed the version number

Update 0.0.2 fixed all known issues:
Implemented:
- The addon now saves data per server and is thereby bettere useable for server hoppers
- Item quality is now also tracked seperately (mainly for equipable items)
- Purchase buffer limited to 100 items per "quality/item" combination to avoid future performance issues
- implemented compatiblity functions for previous beta version users (already tracked data shouldn't get lost)
Removed not used addon dependencies and unused ui xml
General code cleanup
